# AirBnB clone Project
The goal of the  AirBnB clone project is to deploy on a server a simple copy of the [AirBnB website](https://www.airbnb.com/).

The project is a complete web application composed by:
   - A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
   - A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
   - A database or files that store data (data = objects)
   - An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and the data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## What is the command interpreter?

It is similar to a Shell but limited to a specific use-case. In this case, it is used to be able to manage the objects of the project:

   - Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
   - Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
   - Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
   - Update attributes of an object
   - Destroy an object
